# Introduction

This repository contains some introductory material for those interested in adding Python to their professional repertoire. 

By no means is this an all-exhaustive tutorial on the capabilities of Python. The "Intro to Python Notebooks" steps through common 
Python syntax and data structures, importing libraries, plotting data, and creating functions to solve equations. The "Practical Example"
explains how to import and retreive real-world data, perform some general analysis, plot and customize the results, and 
set up a function and loop to automate the process.

I hope this helps demonstrate the increased capabilites Python can have over Excel for certain tasks - and that once you get comfortable
it's easy to learn. Happy coding!
